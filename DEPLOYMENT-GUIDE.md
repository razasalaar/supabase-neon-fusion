# ðŸš€ Deployment Guide - Fix 404 Error

## ðŸš¨ Current Problem

Your Vercel frontend is showing 404 errors because it's trying to call `http://localhost:3001/api/neon-query` but the backend isn't deployed yet.

## âœ… Solution: Deploy Backend to Railway

### Step 1: Deploy Backend to Railway

1. **Go to Railway**: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. **Create New Project** â†’ **Deploy from GitHub repo**
3. **Select Repository**: `supabase-neon-fusion`
4. **Configure Service**:
   - **Service Type**: `Web Service` (NOT Static Site)
   - **Root Directory**: `backend`
   - **Build Command**: `npm install`
   - **Start Command**: `npm start`

### Step 2: Add Environment Variables in Railway

In Railway Dashboard â†’ Your Service â†’ Variables tab:

```
NEON_CONNECTION_STRING=your_neon_connection_string_here
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Step 3: Get Railway URL

After deployment, Railway will give you a URL like:
`https://your-app-name.railway.app`

### Step 4: Update Vercel Environment Variables

In Vercel Dashboard â†’ Your Project â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables:

```
VITE_API_URL=https://your-app-name.railway.app
```

### Step 5: Redeploy Frontend

After adding the environment variable, redeploy your Vercel project.

## ðŸ”§ Quick Test
